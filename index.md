## About Me

My name is Nina van Hoorn and I am currently pursing a Computer Science degree at Skidmore College. Alongside my major, I intend to minor in mathematics and recieve an honors minor when I graduate in Spring 2025.
You can contact me by email at nvhoorn@gmail.com.

## About My Mentor

This summer, I will be conducting research under the guidance of Dr. Orit Peleg, a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. Dr. Peleg is currently studying how organisms (particulaly honeybees) adapt to environmental changes, such as temperature changes. To learn more about Dr. Peleg or her research, visit her website at https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/orit-peleg.

## About My Project

In order to better understand how honeybee swarms change in response to environmental changes, Dr. Peleg's lab has developed an initial proof-of-concept neural network to identify individual bees in 3D images. My goal this summer is to improve this neural network by experimenting with different architectures, exploring other types of machine learning models, and adding more training data.
