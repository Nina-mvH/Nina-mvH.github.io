title: Week 2

Throughout this week I worked on labelling bees in a larger swarm to use for training data. Using the bees I labeled last week, we also looked at the connected components given different thresholds and made some size histograms to better understand the data since I'm ready to begin building a neural network that will take this image data as an input. 

The first form of perliminary analysis I performed was to look at connected components in the original cube of bees. This visualization can be seen below using a threshold of 0.2.

Using this threshold value, there are 61 seperate components, and many are connected (as can be seen by the majority blue 'bees' in the rightmost image). I explored different threshold values ranging from 0.15 to 0.40 to try to find one which best reflected what I would expect the data to look like. Below, histograms showing the distribution of component sizes for some of these thresholds can be seen. In most of these figures, a large spike around 1 can be seen, which reflects the presence of many small, individual pizels, and there is always a very large component which is the background of the image.

I had labeled about 50 individual bees, and the closest I got to this value was 45 bees using a threshold of 0.17:

I then looked at the number of components and the average component sizes as a function of the threshold:

There is a noticable spike in the average component size around threshold value 0.25; below is the corresponding histogram for this threshold value.
