I continued working on neural networks using the small swarm as training data, as shown below.

### Modification 16
- Keeping the original channel numbers, I used an early stopping patience of 5
- The small swarm was divided into 400 cubes with 10 voxels overlap to use for training data
- The network stopped training at epcoh 30/1000 with a training loss of 0.0314 and a validation loss of 0.0365
- When tested on the unseen cube of data, this network had a loss of 0..425
