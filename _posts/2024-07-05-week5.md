At this point of time, based soley on test loss, the best performing model was modification 1, trained on 27 crops. Though this model has the lowest test loss at 0.148, I think that some of the other models may actually perform better, and may just be picking up bees that I didn't identify in my labels, leading to a higher loss. Therefore, I'm not going to fully commit to any network yet.
