Once a well-defined bee has been located and identified, it takes, on average _____ minutes to completely label it (note, this time is significantly higher when the bee is not well defined, which is often the casre)
- 9.36
- 8.03
- 5.43
- 7.28
- 6.54
- 8.40
- 11.05
- 8.26
- 8.00
- 9.51

  
I would roughly estimate that I spend about 75% of my time actually labeling the bees, and the rest (1) locating bees to label, (2) sorting through noise, (3) identifying the boundaries of blurry bees, and (4) prefroming quality control on completed bees. I also took these time measurments after labeling upwards of 350 bees total, so my time had decreased with increased practice....

Therefore, if we were to assume that (1) all bees were well defined, (2) locating the bees was instantaneous, ... it would take roughly ______ hours to label a cube of bees containing ____ individual bees. Labelling a small swarm containign ____ bees would take at least ______ hours. Considering this is an extreme underestimation of the time, it is clear that labeling bees for training data, necessary for the neural network, is an extremely time intensive process...
