title: Week 2

Throughout this week I worked on labelling bees in a larger swarm to use for training data. Using the bees I labeled last week, we also looked at the connected components given different thresholds and made some size histograms to better understand the data since I'm ready to begin building a neural network that will take this image data as an input. 

The first form of perliminary analysis I performed was to look at connected components in the original cube of bees. This visualization can be seen below using a threshold of 0.2.

Using this threshold value, there are 61 seperate components, and many are connected (as can be seen by the majority blue 'bees' in the rightmost image). I explored different threshold values ranging from 0.15 to 0.40 to try to find one which best reflected what I would expect the data to look like. Below, histograms showing the distribution of component sizes for some of these thresholds can be seen. In most of these figures, a large spike around 1 can be seen, which reflects the presence of many small, individual pizels, and there is always a very large component which is the background of the image.

I had labeled about 50 individual bees, and the closest I got to this value was 45 bees using a threshold of 0.17:

I then looked at the number of components and the average component sizes as a function of the threshold:

There is a noticable spike in the average component size around threshold value 0.25; below is the corresponding histogram for this threshold value.

I also made a similar histogram to show the distribution of sizes for the bees that I labeled.

I was quire surprised by the large distribution of bee sizes--I was expecting more of a normal curve centered around one singular area. Instead, the bees seem fairly evenly distributed between 50 pixels large and over 700 pixels large. To better understand this, I visualized the 10 smallest bees and 10 largest bees. I found that the smallest bees were almost entirely bees that were located around the perimeter of the cube, and were therefore cut off in certain areas. The 10 largest bees were around the size that I had come to expect and were not cut off on any edge. 

All 49 bees visualized in 3D space:
