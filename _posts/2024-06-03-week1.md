I started off this week with meeting Danielle Chase, a postdoctoral fellow working in Dr. Peleg's lab, who I will be working under directly. She introduced me to the project and went over the basics of what we will be doing this semester. Following that initial conversation, I read two papers to help familiarize myself with the lab's previous work as well as some methodology we are hoping to use in the near future.
