I spent the bginning on this week continuing to train and test neural netwoks...

### Modification 23
- I halved the original channel numbers and used an early stopping patience of 25
- The small swarm was divided into 605 cubes with 13 voxels overlap to use for training data
- Before training, I loaded the weights of the pretrained model from modification ___- for a starting point
- The network stopped training at epcoh 100/1000 with a training loss of 0.0098 and a validation loss of 0.0251
- When tested on the unseen cube of data, this network had a loss of 0.710
